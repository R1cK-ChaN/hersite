# From Beijing to Singapore

Every meaningful journey is shaped by the places we've been and the choices we've made along the way. Mine has taken me from the bustling academic corridors of Beijing to the vibrant multicultural streets of Singapore.

## The Foundation: CUFE Beijing

My four years studying Economics at the Central University of Finance and Economics gave me a strong analytical foundation. More than the coursework, it taught me how to think critically about systems -- how markets work, why incentives matter, and the invisible forces that shape our everyday decisions.

## The Pivot: NTU Singapore

Moving to Singapore for my Master's in Finance at Nanyang Technological University was one of the best decisions I've made. It wasn't just about deepening my financial knowledge -- it was about stepping into a truly global environment and challenging myself to think bigger.

The diversity of perspectives in Singapore changed how I approach problems. Every conversation with classmates from different backgrounds opened my eyes to new ways of seeing the world.

## Entering Luxury Retail

Joining TPC Group as a Management Trainee was an unexpected but exciting turn. Working alongside some of the world's most prestigious luxury houses -- Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Vacheron Constantin -- has taught me that luxury is ultimately about:

- **Craftsmanship** -- the dedication to perfection in every detail
- **Storytelling** -- every brand carries a heritage worth understanding
- **Human Connection** -- at its core, luxury retail is about building trust

## What I've Learned

A few lessons from the journey so far:

- **Be open to surprises.** The best opportunities often come from paths you didn't plan.
- **Invest in relationships.** People are your greatest asset, in any industry.
- **Stay curious.** The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.

This is just the beginning. I'm grateful for every step that brought me here, and excited for what's ahead.
