# Welcome!

I'm Cynthia, and this is my personal space on the internet.

After years of studying finance and economics across Beijing and Singapore, I've decided to create a place where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and reflections as I navigate the early chapters of my career in luxury retail.

## Why This Site?

In a world of fast-scrolling feeds, I wanted something more intentional -- a space to write longer thoughts, document my journey, and connect with others who share similar interests in:

- **Luxury & Retail** -- the art of craftsmanship, brand storytelling, and client experience
- **Finance & Markets** -- investment thinking, personal finance, and industry insights
- **Cross-Cultural Living** -- what it's like building a life between Beijing and Singapore

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing a mix of personal reflections, professional learnings, and the occasional book recommendation or travel note. Nothing too polished -- just honest observations from where I stand.

Thank you for visiting. I hope you find something here that resonates.
