A new year, a fresh start. As I step into 2026, I want to be intentional about the goals I set and the person I'm becoming. Here are my resolutions across the areas that matter most to me.

## Work

This year, I want to focus on delivering exceptional results in luxury retail management. Being at TPC Group -- surrounded by the world's most prestigious brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels -- is a tremendous opportunity to build deeper industry expertise. My goals:

- Develop stronger leadership skills and take on more strategic responsibilities
- Build deeper product knowledge across our luxury brand portfolio
- Strengthen client relationships through personalized, thoughtful engagement
- Contribute to operational improvements that elevate the customer experience

## Connections

Relationships are the foundation of both personal happiness and professional growth. This year, I want to:

- Strengthen meaningful relationships with friends and family across countries
- Expand my professional network within the luxury and finance industries
- Nurture cross-cultural friendships that broaden my worldview
- Be more intentional about staying in touch with people who matter

## Personal Finance

With my finance background, it's time to practice what I've studied. Goals for 2026:

- Build a solid financial foundation with clear savings targets
- Deepen my understanding of investment strategies beyond textbook theory
- Set up a disciplined monthly savings and investment routine
- Continue learning about wealth management from a practitioner's perspective

## Learning & Perspective

Curiosity is one of my core values. This year, I want to:

- Read more widely -- across business, philosophy, and culture
- Explore different cultures through travel, food, and conversations
- Develop broader worldviews by engaging with diverse perspectives
- Stay curious about the luxury industry's evolving landscape

## Health

None of the above matters without a healthy foundation. My commitments:

- Prioritize both physical and mental wellness
- Maintain a consistent exercise routine
- Practice mindfulness and create space for reflection
- Get better at balancing ambition with rest

Here's to a year of intentional growth, meaningful connections, and becoming a little better each day.
